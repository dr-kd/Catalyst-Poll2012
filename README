Catalyst-Poll2012

Utilities for (de-)normalising the catalyst poll data for analysis.

1.  Work out how to make the QA format sane (done).

2.  Use a combination of regexes and creating new columns to have a sane
representation of multi-answer questions. (TODO).

3.  Analyse/graph using R, cut against dempographic variables etc (TODO).

HOWTO

This code uses test driven data munging.  See t/01-process.t.  Keep adding
stuff to the test to spit out the final data.  Data and metadata lives in
`t/data`.
