I'd like to see more ""Best Practices"", and in my case especially about scaling, which although is not specifically related to Catalyst, helps to think about early on.   People have different needs, but there's often hope of sites growing and need to know that growth can and will be supported.

More focus on Models -- from my experience developers tend to not grasp the concept of using Models to interface with Catalyst and instead use the Controllers for business logic.    Seems common on the list that for new users Catalyst IS the application instead of more of a dispatching layer.

I came to perl in mid-2006, and began to learn web dev few months later. First CGI, then Mason, the someone pointed me to Catalyst. Which I use and love ever since. 

Present:
In the past my app's logic was all in the controllers, latter some business logic moved into DBIC result(set) classes, today its all in $c->model('App') (from the Catalyst point of view), with few controllers.... what I mean is.. wouldn't be too hard to move away from Catalyst... specially when I'm looking forward to some features (like non-blocking baked into core)... I just don't move away coz I love Catalyst! I love the #catalyst channel always helped me! Please guys, don't drift away!!!

Future:
IMHO, I see too much effort to maintain backwards compat, and I think there should be a limit to the backward compatibility commitment. 

I'd love to see Catalyst 6.0, rethought to be the web app framework for the apps of the future!! 
Lets bake it with Bread::Board... with non-blocking features in the core... more PSGI integrated ... and all the features you guys couldnt implement in the 5.x era ... even if that costs backward compatibility.

I think catalyst should continue to move forward. I think that breaking some backwards compatibility at the version 6 mark could be good. An example would be to stop supporting certain older versions of Perl, and deprecated configuration options at that point.

Most of my pain points with Catalyst deal with Plugin's or extensions. I want to do common action X ( like requireSSL ). The plugin module kinda works. My boss won't pay me to rewrite it. So I end up having to code or configure around it's quirks. Having some place (forum or SO like, not IRC ) to talk about these kind of issues besides their CPAN page would be useful. I could see it being a way to get people to pickup orphaned packages, or build alternatives.

I usually only join the IRC channel when I have a question, and I leave it shortly after. At one point in my life I used to idle in IRC all the time. Now, I only connect when I need info. Most of the kids I meet at College don't even know what IRC is. 
I guess what I am saying is we can pickup more people by bringing the community to them. Forums, Facebook Pages, and Google+ Hangouts are more popular to the younger generation. 

I'll do my best to be on IRC for the town hall meeting.","Perl v5.10.*, Perl v5.12.*, Perl v5.14.*, Perl v5.16*, Redhat based Unix, Debian based Unix, Catalyst v5.9*, Catalyst v5.8*",,Pe_Elle

I have no idea what that's supposed to tell me.  Should I have a script called test.pl?  If I don't, where do I get it from?  Is the rest of the synopsis the contents of test.pl?

Later it refers to 'Catalyst test apps into ""t/lib""'.  Wait, an ""app"", whatever that means exactly, goes into a lib directory?  Isn't lib directory for modules?  How does a 'test app' relate to 'test.pl', are they the same or what?

Unfortunately there's plenty more where that came from.

The features continue to improve, and the ease with which I can take advantage of new or more complicated technologies from within the Catalyst ecosystem is impressive.

However, the one thing I have always struggled with in Catalyst (more so than Perl in general) is the amount of outdated, poor, of just missing information scattered around.  In many cases (blogs and tutorials), there is no indication of which Catalyst version is being used, which means the code shown could range from deprecated practices to just plain doesn't work.  In other cases, certain modules or features are painfully under-documented.

The official Catalyst site could do a lot to help the situation but it often seems to lag behind on the latest information, or only parts of the site are kept up to date.  Even now, there are some broken links or wiki pages that could certainly use a refresh.  It also gives the impression that the Catalyst project or the general ecosystem is not as alive and vibrant as I believe it really is.

I don't want to end on a criticism, so I'll finish up by saying that for me personally (a Perl enthusiast and recreational programmer for the last decade), Catalyst has done more to extend my knowledge of an interest in doing projects with Perl than anything else.  The fight to find the right guidance online can be frustrating at times, but the benefits and knowledge I have gained from making Catalyst my go-to tool for building websites certainly make it all worth it in the end.","Perl v5.12.*, Perl v5.14.*, Perl v5.16*, WIndows, Redhat based Unix, Catalyst v5.9*","Documenting the Ecosystem: What is out there, what's current/active, what are best practices/modules for doing XYZ",mattdw@gmail.com

I'm very concerned with the level of 'testing' going on in major plugins.

take Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::OAuth for instance - There is one test and it simply tries to compile.  I spent months trying to piece together how to authenticate my catalyst app with Google (OAuth is only 'tested' with Twitter) - test scripts help with documentation too.

Someone posted a patch that was never introduced and I implemented that for my project to get by

Aside from the bit chin' - I love Catalyst - I've implemented it in a way that allows my designers to write stuff in their templates and it dynamically picks them up and uses them - I don't hard code my template names - which allows the designers the freedom to just make up URLs as they go.  There are different variables at their disposal as they use sub-directories and it just works.

I'd like to see more development in Catalyst where you can pick and choose things much like PHP has with people just downloading and modifying (or just installing) the package - but they need to have more hosting opportunities to go with it.

Even basic stuff, like a rest service, required an extra module and forced me to use subroutines like ""sub thing_GET"", which I find to be very aesthetically unpleasing.  Chaining seems like a good idea, but I found them to be hard to manage due to a lack of a central reference of routes.  It could have been my n00bness, but I found the command line route reporting to be inaccurate at times.   Not to mention my initial usage of detach, which I've discovered is pure evil in terms of long-term maintenance and transparency.

The dependency chain is also something that I found very cumbersome.  Sometimes, I wanted to quickly deploy to a platform in order to test something out, but the large dep chain deters quick-anything.  I found it to negate the spirit of TDD and fast iterations.

The other problem I had with the framework is that there seemed to be a distinct lack of effort into making it feel fresh and new.  At the time, the wiki was chaotic, and the main documentation, being limited to the graphical presentation of search.cpan.org, seemed tired.

To be honest, after a couple production deployments of Catalyst sites, I was about to give up on Perl completely; it seemed like my views on development were not compatible with the Perl community as a whole.  The appearance of some other Frameworks circa 2009 kept me sticking around.

Currently I find Catalyst behind as a modern web framework so we are using Mojolicious. I do not want to see Catalyst broken in the middle of a Major version, but right now we need new major versions, imho. It is time for a Catalyst 6. Catalyst is reliable but it's starting to show bitrot in other ways, it's simply not able to keep up with the technology. Hopefully the plack bits will help.

I think that Catalyst focusing on something like a Cat::Lite equivalent for teaching developers Catalyst Syntax. Also I think that having more route sugar, making something simpler for first time users. Then having a more complex full example that explains how not to use Catalyst where all the logic is in the controller.

I unfortunately am probably no longer target audience because we've decided to base new releases around Mojolicious. But perhaps looking at what mojo is doing right would help. Example I don't think decentralized routing is bad, but perhaps also allowing (documenting)  centralized would be good.

There's also the fact that whenever I did chained routing I'd encounter poorly documented gotcha's (mst knows, and he said it's his fault)","Perl v5.10.*, Perl v5.12.*, Perl v5.14.*, Perl v5.16*, Redhat based Unix, Catalyst v5.9*, Arch Linux",,xenoterracide

I work on a bunch of stuff which makes a lot of use out of Catalyst and it's what I do every day at $work.  So, my career and my pet projects owe a lot to the Catalyst team.  :)

For me personally, I really like what Catalyst can do, but it seems like a bit of a black box to me most of the time.  I first started with CGI::Application for a framework. Coming from that background, once I started playing with Catalyst, it took me a long time to wrap my head around how it works.  I do lots of work with it now, so I have a basic handle on how things work.

What would help a lot, I think is documenting a lot of the stuff that seems to be obvious to the people on IRC but which isn't obvious to the rest of the world.  Stuff like a list of best practices, plugins to use, plugins to avoid, how to best set up your models etc so that you can easily access the stuff you need when running a cron as well as inside the application.

Also, if there were some sample apps on Github which you could easily to deploy to demonstrate best practices, I think that would be great.  If these exist and I don't know about them, I apologize.  I work on MetaCPAN (which is one example of a Catalyst app on Github) but before this I wasn't aware of other real, useful apps you could easily get the source code for.

I've played a bit with Dancer and, because of its simplicity, it was much, much easier for me to get up and running with it than with Catalyst.  I also really like how with Dancer you can easily designate routes for GET vs POST right out of the box.  It makes it so simple to get started with.  Doing the same kind of thing with Catalyst::Action::REST isn't nearly as easy.  So, my inclination at this point is to use Dancer for easy (or RESTish) stuff that I need to get up and running quickly and to use Catalyst for stuff that needs access to a lot of plugins.

Lastly, at this point, it kind of feels easier to contribute to projects which are on Github.  I realize not everyone feels that way, but I do feel like keeping development on Github at this point probably makes it easier for some people to contribute.  Sending a pull request feels a lot easier than asking for a commit bit.","Perl v5.12.*, Perl v5.14.*, Perl v5.16*, Mac OSX, Debian based Unix",,oalders

You've done a great job and it is very much appreciated. It very impressive, fast and flexible system.

A few things: The biggest issue is CPAN and the perl module system. There needs to be a really simple way of loading everything up for dev and to deploy to prod as (perhaps) a single command. I'm aware of attempts being made, but they are always let down by the perl module testing problems. I can pretty well bet that something will go wrong to prevent an automated install, almost always involving testing phase of cpan installation. Cpan modules are both perl's greatest strength but also its Achilles heal. For example, the mojolicious wiki app should be a great reusable resource, but it has a vast set of dependencies that are too visible for a deployment (c.f. linked java or C object code). Can we fix this with par or a compiler approach? Even just an archive of modules? Or is our problem the one java had, that we ought to be preferring pure-perl implementations as the external (system) dependencies are much reduced.

Secondly, You are completely right that now is a good time to look at overall direction. Things like dancer, mojolicous and node.js are showing easy ways of trying out techniques that will be important in the future, like socket.io and distributed DBs - essentially integrating a greater degree of autonomous event flow without getting to huge cpan frameworks.

Thirdly, as you will have noticed, there is a trend to JS based client side, which we need to support with socket.io, etc. There are many very interesting experiments which we should keep an eye on. In fact, it might be that we can't think of a good way to do this other than making it easy to drop into JS script code or cross calling node.js.

Fourthly, reusable applications that can be skinned and adapted would be great in CPAN, maybe as patterns. 

Fifthly, if you decided to make a big break in API/use for Catalyst 6 to support new ideas, just make sure that *calling* cat 5.x functions is bomb proof. Backward compatibility is much appreciated, but at some point I do understand that things have to change.","Perl v5.8.*, Perl v5.14.*, Mac OSX, Redhat based Unix, Debian based Unix, Catalyst v5.9*, Catalyst v5.8*",,nigel@systemgarden.com

For some reason I had thought that catalyst was a really outdated methodology, which is why I did not choose it at first. 
Catalyst could use some marketing to promote its Modern Pearl features and capabilities. People need to know about it and what it does. This may seem obvious, but to me, the marketing that is used to promote Catalyst is too vague and hidden. It needs to be ""Out There"".
It would also be nice to have more integration with Java Script, jQuery. Hey, even Android app development.

This would help me try new things faster, with the option to tweak them later to suit my specific situation.

I would also like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who has ever worked on Catalyst, and especially the core team.  It's an amazing piece of software that is a real joy to work with.

However, the failing of the coder is *not* the problem of the catalyst core team.  Don't gnome out... you guys make a great product, and if you've lost your direction, please get it back, Catalyst is the only framework that makes sense (to me).


Also, Catalyst is one of the few places that people actually have access to the developers via IRC.  I know it's split, and i'm on the mailing list to - few of the IRC folks are on the mailing list && vice versa.  That's a GOOD thing.  Keep it going if those people have the energy to do so.

For example, take the URL http://localhost:3000/foo/bar/baz. Imagine I need to make a change to the page that is shown at this address. I would start by looking for a 'sub baz' in a Foo/Bar.pm controller. It might not be there, because Foo.pm or Bar.pm have 'baz' in a Path attribute, so now I have to go hunting for that.

Another example is the stash, which is too easy to use as a global variable stash. My template uses 'somevar', and I need to find where it was set. Any of the methods in the controllers that were used in executing that URL have could have set it.

I would love the --debug output of *_server.pl to show me the execution path that is taken when a page request is made, even if it's just a list of controller methods that were called. ""perl -d *_server.pl"" is too unwieldy for this.

If there is a way to do any of that, and I just don't know about it, then I'd suggest adding it to the debugging section of the manual.","Perl v5.8.*, Perl v5.10.*, Perl v5.12.*, Perl v5.14.*, Perl v5.16*, Redhat based Unix, Debian based Unix, Other Unix, Catalyst v5.9*",,catalyst345632@rainslide.net

(I don't follow the mailing list, web site, IRC, or releases.) Once managing a project where it was used, and in another case helping to evaluate it as a potential framework for a project. In the latter case, Dancer was chosen instead, despite a recommendation from myself and the developer I was working with for Catalyst, which we felt had better internal architecture and was a more proven project. (And we were pretty much proven correct in the course of the project, encountering bugs and architecture issues with Dancer.)

While there isn't much you can do about the practice in IT to go after the new and shiny thing, it does seem like there are opportunities to revise Catalyst to offer the same benefits as some of the newer tools. For example, move further in the direction of having a minimal core kernel, so that complexity and dependencies are minimized. Relegate everything else to plug-ins. (Our client was strongly influenced by Dancer's minimal dependent module count.) 

Package Catalyst so that it has a super easy ""out of the box"" experience, with template applications and a bundled web server. (Maybe you already do this? If so, publicize it.) Consider bundling new APIs layered on top of the Catalyst core that provide the Dancer-like syntax, that many seem to prefer. (Perhaps a plug-in already exists for this.)

Consider the marketing benefit to releasing such a bundle under a new name on CPAN. (Something new and shiny to pull in those who dismiss Catalyst as being the framework of 5 years ago.) It could be built from a standard Catalyst release using automation, so minimal additional maintenance overhead, and once you've brought a new developer into the fold, they'll be using something that is fully compatible with the greater Catalyst ecosystem.
